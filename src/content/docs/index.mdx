## What is Asteroid Impact?

Asteroid Impact is an interactive, arcade-style, point-and-click video game designed for use as an experimental stimulus in communication and cognitive science research. Players pilot a spaceship to collect crystals while avoiding asteroids, with an embedded reaction-time probe task for measuring cognitive resource allocation.

The game is built in Unity and runs in any modern web browser via WebGL — no download or installation required.

## Research applications

Asteroid Impact has been used to study:

- **Spatial proximity and reward magnitude** — how the distance between a player and a reward affects attention allocation and reaction time ([Reward Proximity Study](https://osf.io/38der))
- **Cognitive load and perceptual load** — optional manipulations available via round configuration
- **Immersion and motivated attention** — post-round surveys assess engagement, motivation, and perceived difficulty
