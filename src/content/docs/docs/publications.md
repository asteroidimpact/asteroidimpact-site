## Studies using Asteroid Impact

### Reward Proximity Study

**Research question:** How do the spatial proximity and magnitude of rewards affect attention allocation and reaction time during game play?

**Design:** 2×2 within-subjects (Reward: High/Low × Spatial Proximity: Proximal/Distal). Secondary-task reaction time (STRT) and self-reported immersion as dependent variables.

**Key findings:**
- High reward + distal proximity consistently produced the longest reaction times across five pilot studies — suggesting that distant, high-value rewards consume the most cognitive resources
- Proximal rewards produced higher immersion across studies
- The reward × proximity interaction was significant in within-subjects designs
